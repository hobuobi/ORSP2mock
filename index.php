      <h3>The good:</h3>
      <p>Dennis was great to work with. Professional and quick to respond via Yelp. He hung 3 light fixtures, one in a pretty treacherous spot and even fixed the lighting which ended up having a cheap plastic part (this did get a fair amount of griping, so fair warning).</p>

    <div class="review negative">
      <h3>The bad:</h3>
      <p>He took it down and tried to repair the housing, but ultimately, after a while of tinkering, hung it back up and it ended up crashing to the floor, snapping the arms and marking up my hardwood floor.  </p>
